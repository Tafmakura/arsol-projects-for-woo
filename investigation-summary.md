I have investigated the conditional logic for the start date in the "Products and services" section of the invoice. Here is a detailed explanation of how it works:

The visibility of the "Start Date" field is determined by whether a product is a WooCommerce Subscription. This logic is primarily handled in the `assets/js/arsol-pfw-admin-proposal.js` file.

### The Core Logic

When you add a product to the "Products & Services" section of a proposal, the system checks if it's a subscription product.

1.  **AJAX Call**: An AJAX request is sent to the server to fetch the product's details. This happens in the `fetchProductDetails` function in the JavaScript file mentioned above.

2.  **Conditional Check**: The key logic is inside the `success` callback of this AJAX call:

    ```javascript
    if (data.is_subscription) {
        $row.find('.arsol-date-input').show();
        // ...
    } else {
        $row.find('.arsol-date-input').hide();
        // ...
    }
    ```

    - If the product data from the server (`data`) has the property `is_subscription` set to `true`, the "Start Date" input field is shown for that line item.
    - If `is_subscription` is `false`, the "Start Date" field is hidden.

3.  **Column Visibility**: There's also a function called `toggleStartDateColumn` that shows or hides the entire "Start Date" table column. This column is displayed if at least one product line item has a visible start date field or if there are any items in the "Recurring Fees" section (as recurring fees always have a start date).

### Where to Find the Code

-   **JavaScript Logic**: `assets/js/arsol-pfw-admin-proposal.js` (lines 200-221 and 242-261 in the version I have)
-   **Server-side PHP**: The `ajax_get_product_details` function in `includes/custom-post-types/project-proposal/class-project-proposal-cpt-admin-proposal-invoice.php` is what sends the `is_subscription` data to the JavaScript.

### Summary

In short, the "Start Date" field in the "Products and services" section is exclusively for subscription-based products, allowing you to set a specific commencement date for the subscription. For standard, one-time purchase products, this field is not available.
